          P2P.Help is a unique crowdfunding platform where people help each
          other by giving and receiving funds as a charity to support their
          personal Goal. It’s also called “P2P Helping System” or “P2P Helping
          Community”. All transactions are made directly between givers and
          receivers as there is no middleman in between the giver and the
          receiver.
        </p>
        <p>
          P2P.Help’s core principles are that people have unprecedented power to
          use the power of networks to leverage their personal capacity and that
          raising money as a charity to support your goal should be fun.
          P2P.Help’s custom-built platform and proven record of building
          innovative crowd-funding strategies, providing individual fundraisers,
          charities, and events with powerful tools to raise the money for their
          causes and share compelling philanthropic stories with their personal
          networks. The site lets anyone turn their friends into an active base
          of donors for any cause and lets any organization, company, or event
          unlock untapped leverage out of their existing platform.
        </p>

              The role. The purpose of the site and services is to help
              individuals, entities or organizations to raise funds, but not to
              pick or endorse any such individuals, entities or organizations or
              any of their campaigns or causes. It’s just a technology platform
              to allow fundraisers to connect with donors. The existence of the
              site or services is not a solicitation of donations by P2P.Help,
              and P2P.Help does not engage in any solicitation activities, or
              consult on the solicitation of contributions from the public, on
              behalf of any individual, entity, or organization. In order to
              ensure that P2P.Help does not go out of business (GOB) and to
              provide you with the very best experience and customer service,
              P2P.Help will charges certain fees for donations and event
              registrations made on or through the site. At now the platform is
              available for free.
